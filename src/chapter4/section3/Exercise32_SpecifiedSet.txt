4.3.32 - Specified set

1- Create a new graph G' containing all the edges in S.
2- Sort all edges of the original graph G by weight.
3- Iterate through the sorted edges and for each edge:
   3.1- If it is already part of G', do nothing and continue the iteration.
   3.2- If adding it to G' will generate a cycle, do nothing and continue the iteration.
   3.3- If all the above is false and it does not generate a cycle, add it to G'.
4- Repeat the above iteration until G' has V - 1 edges (where V is the number of vertices in G).
5- G' is now the minimum-weight spanning tree of G containing all the edges in S. Return it.

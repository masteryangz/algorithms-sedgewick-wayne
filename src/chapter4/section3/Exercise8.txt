4.3.8

Given any cycle in an edge-weighted graph (all edge weights distinct), the edge of maximum weight in the cycle does not belong to the MST of the graph.

Proof:
Consider by contradiction that the edge of maximum weight in the cycle C, edge e, belongs to the MST of the graph.
Let's call this MST T1.
If we delete edge e, T1 breaks into two subtrees, with the two ends of edge e in different subtrees.
The remainder of C reconnects the subtrees, hence there is an edge f of C with ends in different subtrees, i.e., it reconnects the subtrees into a tree T2, with weight less than that of T1, because the weight of edge f is less than the weight of edge e, contradicting T1's minimality.
